# Summary: Auto Capture Selfie by Detecting Smile

In this project, we aim to create an application that automatically captures a selfie photo when the user smiles. The project will utilize computer vision techniques to detect the presence of a smile in real-time using a camera.

## Technologies Used

* OpenCV: a popular computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing, including facial recognition and detection.
* Python: a programming language that will be used to write the application code.

## Approah

* The application will use the following approach to detect smiles and capture selfies:
* The camera will capture a continuous stream of images.
* The images will be processed using OpenCV's facial recognition and detection algorithms to detect the presence of a smile.
* When a smile is detected, the application will capture a selfie photo.
* The photo will be saved to the user's device or uploaded to a cloud storage service.
* The process will continue until the user stops the application.

## Conclusion

The auto capture selfie using smile detection is an exciting project that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques. With the right implementation, this has the potential to be a fun and engaging way for users to capture photos of themselves.
